# Podcasting - Lessons Learnt

This is a slide deck for a talk that I originally gave at NE-RPC about getting into podcasting. It covers some of the things that most podcasters will need to know when they first start out.

It is built with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), which is a JavaScript package for creating Markdown based HTML slide decks.

## Requirements

This slide deck is provided as a compiled HTML site. However, it requires the use of a server.

In preparing this slide deck, I used VS Code and an extension called [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). There are no build requirements for this slide deck.

## Running The Presentation

Open the root of the repository with a live server and head to the url exposed by the server. For example, if using VS Code and [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer):

- Open the repository with VS Code
- Open the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)
- Type `> Live Server: Open with Server`
- A browser window should open with the slide deck running

Tip: remember to hit the `s` key when deck is displayed in the browser for speaker notes
