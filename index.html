                        - Without the organisers, there would be no event

                        - What _is_ a podcast?

                            It all starts with an idea. If you don't have an idea, then you don't have a show. <br />
                            As much as Seinfeld was a show about nothing, your podcast can't be a show about nothing. <br />
                            Because people wont listen for hours at a time to nothing <br />
                            You'll likely need a bunch of ideas before you start

                            Having a plan means that you can fall back on episode ideas <br />
                            But you can't have a plan without having the show idea <br />

                            Software recording is a great place to start<br/>
                            Audacity is great, and free, but buggy <br/>
                            Garage Band is free (if you own Apple hardware) <br/>
                            Discord (with plugins), Clean Feed, SquadCast, and ZenCastr <br/>
                            Skype has addons for recording <br/>
                            Hardware recorders are best <br/>

                            There is no "perfect day" to release a show <br />
                            Podcasts are consumed on-demand <br />
                            If your show isn't about current affairs/news - release when suits you <br />
                            Like cadence, set a day and time that you can maintain <br />
                            Automate and schedule what you can

                            when a show disappears after only a few episodes <br />
                            "a few" is usually < 21 <br />
                            Usually because someone starts, but doesn't realise how difficult maintaining is <br />
